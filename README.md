# 🪻 Ekvisa

Learning to turn the poetry of code into the art of applications. My current playground is Frontend.

### Main Stack
* **HTML + CSS** — deep knowledge of semantic, adaptive, and clean layouts (Sass / Flex / Grid / Bootstrap / Tailwind) 🌾
* **JavaScript** — solid level, confident with logic, API, DOM, and application structure 🌿
* **React** — beginner level, exploring components and modern front-end flow 🌱

👾 I enjoy creating projects for fun and learn. Except pinned ones, I love these small ones:
* [Mondrian](https://github.com/Ekvisa/Mondrian): a picture created by SCSS ([Live](https://ekvisa.github.io/MomFriendsDesigner/)),
* [JS Calendar](https://github.com/Ekvisa/JSCalendar): wall calendar in JS ([Live](https://ekvisa.github.io/JSCalendar/)),
* [Olympics-80 logo](https://github.com/Ekvisa/olympics80logosvg): one more picture coded from scratch, but in SVG.


Also you can find here some Java ☕ projects from one of my past lives. Sometimes I miss Java’s structure while enjoying the freedom of JS.

I’m open to learning, creating, and collaborating on meaningful projects. Let’s build something beautiful together. 💜
