👾 I love creating small projects for fun and learn. Here are some beloved but unpinned projects:
* [Mondrian](https://github.com/Ekvisa/Mondrian): a picture created by SCSS ([Live](https://ekvisa.github.io/MomFriendsDesigner/)),
* [JS Calendar](https://github.com/Ekvisa/JSCalendar): wall calendar in JS ([Live](https://ekvisa.github.io/JSCalendar/)),
* [Olympics-80 logo](https://github.com/Ekvisa/olympics80logosvg): one more picture coded from scratch, but in SVG.


Also you can find here some Java ☕ projects from one of my past lives. Sometimes I miss Java’s structure while enjoying the freedom of JS.

I’m always open to learning, creating, and collaborating on meaningful projects. Let’s build something beautiful together. 💜
